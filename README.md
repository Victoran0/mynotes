# Using A Django Restful API for the backend, we have create a Notes APP that uses React JS on the frontend

## Required dependencies for the django part
### `django-cors-headers`
### `djangorestframework`

## Required dependencies for the React Aspect, (although it is only the build folder that is pushed to this repository but you can check my other repository which says react-notes-app with django API to see the files for the react-app). SO you can easily design your own unique API or use the same one from this section...

#### Enjoy as you check it out!!!
